## What is Frisbee ?

Frisbee is a workflow-based engine that lowers the threshold of testing containerized applications on Kubernetes. 

Frisbee is implemented as a set of Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition) that:

* Setup initial application stack â€“ easily!

* Test against actual, close to production software - no mocks!

* Replay complex workloads written in an intuitive language!

* Combine Chaos Engineering with large-scale performance testing!

* Assert actual program behavior and side effects.

## Getting Started



#### Step 1. Fix Dependencies

Before starting, Make sure that [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) and  [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) are installed on your system.



#### Step 2. Install Frisbee CLI and Frisbee Platform

Then, run the `install.sh`, that will deploy the Frisbee terminal  as an extension to  `kubectl`.

```shell
curl -sSLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/frisbee/main/install.sh | bash
```

From now on, all Frisbee operations will be available via `kubectl frisbee`.

<img src="docs/readme.assets/kubect-frisbee.png" alt="image-20220902175233546" style="zoom:80%;" />



After the Frisbee Terminal is install, you can install the Frisbee Platform using

```shell
kubectl frisbee install production
```



Finally, download the Frisbee repo from GitHub.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:CARV-ICS-FORTH/frisbee.git
```



Notice that the last step is not required for the installation of Frisbee Platform. 
It is useful though as it allows us to to the `examples` and `charts` locally.



### Step 3. Submit a Testing Workflow.

Firstly, let's list the available examples.

```shell
>> tree -v  examples/
examples/
â”œâ”€â”€ 1.hello-world.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 2.parameters.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 3.execution-order.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 4.dependency-order.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 5.clustering.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 6.time-driven-scheduling.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 7.event-driven-scheduling.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 8.conditional-scheduling.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 9.tolerate-failures.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 10.resource-throttling.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 11.advanced-placement.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 12.callables.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 13.assertions.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 14.delete-job.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 15.performance-monitoring.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 16.simulate-failure.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 17.simulate-cascading-failures.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 18.revoke-failures.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 19.sla-assertions.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 20.distributed-logs.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ 21.custom-storage.yml
â””â”€â”€ 22.diagnostics.yml
```



Let's start by running a simple `hello-world`.

```shell
kubectl frisbee submit test demo- ./examles/1.hello-world.yml
```

Note that if a testname has `-` as a postfix (e.g, `demo-`), Frisbee will autogenerate the test name.

<img src="docs/readme.assets/submit.png" alt="image-20220902182750771" style="zoom:80%;" />



If we submit multiple jobs, Frisbee will create its jobs on  its own dedicated namespace.

To get a list of available tests, use.

```shell
kubectl frisbee get tests
```



<img src="docs/readme.assets/list.png" alt="image-20220902183147118" style="zoom:80%;" />



The above command provides an overview of the details, but does not really help into investigating what happened. To do so, you can use:

```shell
kubectl frisbee inspect tests demo-482
```



<img src="docs/readme.assets/inspect.png" alt="image-20220902183520716" style="zoom:80%;" />



Notice that the `hello-world` example ended almost immediately.

This, however, is rarely the case. Most frequently, we need a visual way to inspect the `real-time` progress of a test-case (or a deployment). 

For this reason. Frisbee provides `system templates (charts/systems)` for out-of-the-box integration with the Prometheus and Grafana Stack. 



Let's try the `performance-monitoring` example to understand how to use it.

```shell
kubectl frisbee submit test demo- examples/15.performance-monitoring.yml
```



<img src="docs/readme.assets/submit-visual.png" alt="image-20220902184603844" style="zoom:80%;" />



Oops .... the job has failed. Let's inspect what happened ....

<img src="docs/readme.assets/inspect-failed.png" alt="image-20220902184746969" style="zoom: 80%;" />



Aha. There is a missing dependency. We haven't installed the `system templates`. 

To do so, simply `append` the dependencies after the scenario file.

```shell
kubectl frisbee submit test demo- examples/15.performance-monitoring.yml charts/system charts/networking/iperf2
```


Notice that besides the `telemetry templates` (which are part of the `charts/system`), the exact has also dependencies to `iperf` for generating the traffic.



![image-20220902185553533](docs/readme.assets/submit-dependencies.png)


Instead of using `get` to list the tests and get the `test id`, another way is to take it directly from the `submit` output and use it in `inspect`.



![image-20220902185821186](docs/readme.assets/inspect-dashboards.png)



Given the output, all that it takes to understand the progress for the experiment is to open the URLs of `Visualization Dashboards` in your browser. You can do it by hand, or using this one-liner:

```shell
firefox $(kubectl frisbee inspect tests demo-710 | grep grafana- | awk '{print $3'})
```

Hint: we can create pipelines that open new brower tabs every time you start a new experiment. 



![image-20220902191141426](docs/readme.assets/grafana.png)



Notice that in contrast to the vanilla Grafana that plots just the performance metrics, Frisbee also enriches Grafana with `Contextualized Visualizations`. In the previous graph, the `blue vertical lines` provide information on `joining` services, whereas the `orange vertical lines` provide information on `exiting` services. 

Visualization like that helpful in `root-cause analysis`, as it makes it easy to correlate an `observed behavior back to a testing event`. For example, in the next figure, it fairly easy to understand that `INSERT_ERROR` messages (`yellow line`) are triggered by a `fault-injection event`.
