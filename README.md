# Why Frisbee ?

Frisbee is a next generation testbed tool built for exploring, testing, and benchmarking modern applications. We address
the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing cloud-native applications.

We make it possible to:

* **Write tests:**  for stressing complex topologies and dynamic operating conditions.

* **Run tests:**  provides seamless scaling from a single workstation to hundreds of machines.

* **Debug tests:**  through extensive monitoring and comprehensive dashboards

In this walk-through, we explain how to install and execute the examples in a single-node using the Microk8s flavor of Kubernetes.



For a single-node deployment click [here](docs/singlenode-deployment.md).

For a multi-node deployment click [here](docs/cluster-deployment.md).

## Bugs, Feedback, and Contributions

The original intention of our open source project is to lower the threshold of testing distributed systems, so we highly
value the use of the project in enterprises and in academia.
