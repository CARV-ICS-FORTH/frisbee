# TiKV



TiKV is a highly scalable, low latency, and easy to use key-value database.



## TL;DR

```console
>> helm repo add frisbee https://carv-ics-forth.github.io/frisbee
>> helm install my-release bitnami/influxdb
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [influxdb](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/influxdb
```

These commands deploy influxdb on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` statefulset:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release. Use the option `--purge` to delete all history too.
