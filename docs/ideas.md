Some good scenarios to begin with are:

    Add latency
    Make services and dependencies unavailable
    Throw exceptions randomly
    Cause packet loss across the network
    Fail requests by dropping them or providing failure responses
    Add resource contention such as CPU hogging processes, high network volume, broken sockets, unavailable file descriptors
